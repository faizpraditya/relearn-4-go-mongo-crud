// can also run this if bson doesn't included after running "gopkg.in/mgo.v2"
go get "gopkg.in/mgo.v2/bson"

Ensure you are using the latest version of the MongoDB Go driver.
The gopkg.in/mgo.v2 package is the old MongoDB driver.
The recommended driver is go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver. Consider migrating to the new driver, as the old mgo driver is deprecated.
go get go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver
